# Time Management and Task Prioritization System

## Project Description
The Time Management and Task Prioritization System is designed to help users efficiently manage their time by prioritizing tasks based on deadlines and importance. The system also tracks the time spent on each task, enabling users to stay organized and enhance their productivity.

This review involves creating HTML templates for user management, styled using CSS and Bootstrap, along with JavaScript implementations for form validation and interactivity.

## Features
- **Home Page**: The home page serves as the welcome page where you can log in or register. Currently, the project includes templates, so you can navigate to `./profile/profile.html` to view the profile page.
- **HTML Templates**: Professionally designed templates for user management (e.g., login, registration, user profile).
- **CSS and Bootstrap Styling**: Responsive and visually consistent templates across different screen sizes using CSS and Bootstrap.
- **JavaScript Validation and Interactivity**: Form validation (e.g., email, password strength, required fields) and interactivity, such as dynamic field error messages and live input feedback.
